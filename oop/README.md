# aMatrix
## Implementing a 2D matrix in C++.

The requirements for implemeting the 2-dimensional matrix class in C++ are the following:
  * class name is aMatrix
  * base type for the matrix will be real numbers (double)
  * exceptions thrown if operation is not possible
  * basic matrix <-> double operations (+ - * /)
  * basic matrix <-> matrix operations (+ - * /)  when possible
  * determinant calculation
  * matrix inverse calculation
  * basic default matrix (O and I)
