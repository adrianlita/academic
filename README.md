# academic

This repository contains projects used for teaching different topics to students in the electrical and electronic engineering.
Everything posted here is my personal work (with exceptions where I clearly mention them), and you are free to use this under an MIT license.

Once again I personally want to stress that **everything** here is made with a clear mind for **purely academic** purposes. This means that it may not be the finest, error-checked implementation, and this code is not meant to be used in *production*. However, nothing forbids you to do so, but at your own risk.

Topics will include:
  * object oriented programming
  * data structures
  * algorithms
  * other topics, check again soon
